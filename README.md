sup, im @SteelNil
you can just call me renato or ren tho.
currently learning lua (more specifically luau)

i know moderate lua, i would say metatables were the last thing i learned.
if you have some trouble in a project youre making, i can try to help you. but dont expect me to know everything/be good at math.
